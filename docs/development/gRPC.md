gRPC
====

The required go packages have already been installed with the help of the setup shell script.

Compiling the gRPC interfaces requires installing the "protoc" compiler as described in https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/go.html.

The specification for the message interface can be found in: "src/tsai.eu/solar/controller/solar.proto".

The message interface can be generated by invoking the following command from the root directory:

```
> protoc -I src tsai.eu/solar/controller/solar.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:src
```

It will update the file "src/tsai.eu/solar/controller/solar.pb.go".

To adjust the reference gRPC controller copy this file to the directory "src/tsai.eu/solar/controller/gRPC" by overwriting the previous one.

In addition it is neccesary to change the go package name of the file from "controller" to "main".

All gRPC controllers are expected to expose their service at port 10000. This port will be mapped to another port of the container runtime environment.

The gRPC controllers are expected to support all interfaces:

* check
* status
* create
* destroy 
* configure
* reconfigure
* reset
* start
* stop
